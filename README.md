# British sign laguage translator
This project aims to develop a Sign Language Translator using TensorFlow object detection API that reads sign language and convert them into English words.<br>
The model is built on a pre trained model by using transfer learning.<br>
The custom dataset used in this is project is collected manually by running the code present in the __Image Collection python file__.<br>

The British Sign Language used in this project:<br>
**Hello** ‚úã<br>
**I Love You**‚ù§<br>
**Thank you**üôå

The image annotations is done with the help of LabelImage file which you can use by running the code present in the __Image Collection python file__.<br>

The model was made with help of [Nicholas Renotte tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqkISICHH-U). Thank you sir for inspiring many students like me.
